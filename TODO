- basics API changes
    - remove public: and private: identation !!!
    - remove prefix get_
    - remove suffix _list
    - add const to accessors
    - Note::operator > ?? hydrogen.cpp operator()
    - Pattern::__virtual* encapsulation must be checked
    - Drumkit::installl must be checked
    - remove include replace with class definition
    - use Note::Key within set_key_octave ... and set Note::Octave
    - InstrumentList could check for double in add ???
    - sample.cpp 252... chose sample from velocity => Instrument:: ??
    - remove brief from doxygen

Sample*
    Sample::apply_loop( mode, count, start_frame, loop_frame, end_frame );
    class SampleEnvelope instead of VeloPanVector, don't need it in hydorgen, only Sample and SampleEditor
    - use rubberband API instead of binary !!!!!

- what todo with globals.h ???

- use #define HEIGHT_XX 12 int PianoRollEditor ...
- see ca59f17ffeddd7847bd17f00260e83b9840df841 pref->patternModePlaysSelected seems to be broken
- usage of Instrument::load_instrument seems to be wrong
- int Hydrogen::loadDrumkit( Drumkit *drumkitInfo ) is pretty ugly
- is it nessecary to have 2 queues, the priority one and the sampler one

GUI
- SampleEditor
    - should have Sample* fs_sample, live_sample, edit_sample and work with it, that's all
    - use #define for WaveDisplay width and height
- SongEditor Pattern management
    - void SongEditorPatternList::patternPopup_delete()
        - useless :
        - Song *song = pEngine->getSong();
	    - PatternList *pSongPatternList = song->get_pattern_list();
    - void SongEditorPatternList::deletePatternFromList( QString patternFilename, QString sequenceFileName, int patternPosition )
	    H2Core::Pattern *pattern = pSongPatternList->get( patternPosition );
	    INFOLOG( QString("[patternPopup_delete] Delete pattern: %1 @%2").arg(pattern->get_name()).arg( (long)pattern ) );
	    pSongPatternList->del(pattern);
        =>
	    H2Core::Pattern *pattern = pSongPatternList->del(patternPosition);
	    INFOLOG( QString("[patternPopup_delete] Delete pattern: %1 @%2").arg(pattern->get_name()).arg( (long)pattern ) );
        ...
- SoundLibraryPanel, tree widget, and list management
    - don't destroy and rebuild all at each and every change !!!
