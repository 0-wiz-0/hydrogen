Hydrogen runs on all kinds of linux distribution, but then the package names and installation tools will differ. \r\n\r\n#Required libraries\r\n\r\n* libqt4-dev\r\n* libasound-dev\r\n* libsndfile-dev\r\n* libjack-dev\r\n* liblrdf-dev\r\n* libflac++-dev\r\n* libtar-dev\r\n* liblash-dev\r\n* zlib1g-dev \r\n\r\nOn a debian based system, you can fetch the mandatory libraries with:\r\n`apt-get install git-core cmake libqt4-dev g++ libasound2-dev libjack-dev liblrdf0-dev libflac++-dev libtar-dev libsndfile1-dev `\r\n\r\nYou should use QT 4.6 or higher. In addition, you need a libjack > 1.9.7.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use lash, install additionally: `liblash-dev`\r\n\r\nIf you want to use rubberband, install additionally: `librubberband-dev`\r\n\r\nIf you want to use OSS, install additionally: `oss4-dev`\r\n\r\nFor portaudio / portmidi: `libportaudio-dev libportmidi-dev`\r\n\r\n## 1. Get the sourcecode\r\n\r\n`cd /usr/src`\r\n`git clone git://github.com/hydrogen-music/hydrogen.git`\r\n\r\n## 2. Compile and install hydrogen:\r\n\r\ncd /usr/src/hydrogen\r\n./build.sh m\r\n\r\n## 3.  Build a debian package\r\n\r\nIf you're using a debian based system, you can build a debian package. This makes it easier to remove hydrogen from your system.\r\n\r\napt-get install fakeroot debhelper build-essential\r\ncd /usr/src/hydrogen/linux\r\nfakeroot dpkg-buildpackage\r\n\r\nThe package appears in /usr/src/hydrogen and can be installed with dpkg (dpkg -i package_name) \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
